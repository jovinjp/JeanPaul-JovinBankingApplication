## Bad Bank

<h2>Brief Despcription</h2>
<p>This is a Bad-Bank Front-End assignment that I have worked on from MIT xPRO. It will show a series of process: 
  Create Account -- multiple users are able to signup by entering name, email and password(8 characters are more;
  Login -- after character creation, you could use both email and password to log in;
  Deposit -- You may test it by deposit any amount greater than $0 to see if the message will show that it was a success or not;
  Withdraw -- same as the deposit, users can test it by withdrawing amount greater than $0; however, over the balance will pop-up a message and will not let you go over your limit;
  Balance -- this is the area once you made a deposit and/or withdrawn, you'll be able to see the amounts;
  All Data -- is where the informations are stored once you login, deposit and/or withdrawn to keep track of.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>You will be able to navigate through this project to test the deposit, withdraw and inspect the other areas. If you attempt to put a negative amount, it will be rejected. If you attempt to withdraw more than the available balance, it will denied the withdrawal</p>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Current working on the "Back-End" part of this project by refactoring a few components in order to set it up on one of the data storage which authentication will be possible as well as other modification to improve the use of this application.</p>
<h2>How to run</h2>
<p>You can click the link https://jovinjp.github.io/JeanPaul-JovinBankingApplication/ to test it out. Also, you can pull it to your system by following this steps:
Open your command-line (GitBash)
